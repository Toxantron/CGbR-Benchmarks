# CGbR-Benchmarks
Benchmarks comparing the performance of code generated by CGbR with alternative implementations. 

## Serialization
The different serializers were put into test to give an overview of performance and size. Those tests were run on a AMD FX-8350 Windows Virtual Machine in Debug and Release mode after an initial JIT run and on an i5 Ubuntu compiled with release and `mono --aot`. Absolute values do not matter as this is more a relative comparison. As you will see the generated version is always faster.

| Test | WindowsVM (Debug) | WindowsVM (Release) | Mono AOT |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| JSON size | 21042 | 21042 | 21042 |
| Json.NET serialize (ms) | 1,494 | 1,299 | 1,077 |
| Json.NET deserialize (ms) | 3,016 | 2,356 | 0,828 |
| Generator Json serialize (ms) | 0,598 | 0,606 | 0,433 |
| Generator Json deserialize (ms) | 0,651 | 0,576 | 0,670 |
| Binary size | 12720 | 12720 | 12720 |
| Binary serialize | 0,123 | 0,041 | 0,059 |
| Binary deserialize | 0,062 | 0,041 | 0,055 |
